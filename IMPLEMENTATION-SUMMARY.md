## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Service Worker Caching Strategy

**Static Assets (Cache-First):**

- HTML files
- CSS files
- JavaScript files
- Fonts
- Icons

**API Calls (Network-First with Fallback):**

- Supabase API requests cached on success
- Falls back to cache when offline
- Returns offline message if no cache available

### Database Schema Additions

**New Tables:**

1. `clients` - Normalized client data (optional, clients can exist only in orders)
2. `bouquet_types` - Product catalog
3. `invoices` - Invoice headers
4. `invoice_items` - Invoice details with order linkage

**Updated Tables:**

1. `orders` - Added: client_id, bouquet_type, price_hkd, delivery_time_slot, card_message

**Functions:**

1. `generate_invoice_number()` - Auto-generates sequential invoice numbers
2. `update_updated_at_column()` - Trigger function for timestamp updates

### State Management

**Global State Variables:**

```javascript
let orders = []; // All orders
let invoices = []; // All invoices
let bouquetTypes = []; // Active bouquet types
let editingOrderId = null; // Current order being edited
let editingInvoiceId = null; // Current invoice being edited
let selectedOrdersForInvoice = new Set(); // Orders selected for invoice
```

### Event Handling

**New Event Listeners:**

- Invoice dialog open/close
- Invoice status filter
- Client sort dropdown
- Client search input
- Bouquet type selection (auto-fill price)
- Order checkbox selection (update invoice total)
- Settings button click
- PWA install prompt

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**Orders Table:**

- Public can INSERT (for client order form)
- Authenticated users can SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE

**Bouquet Types:**

- Public can SELECT active bouquets only
- Authenticated users can manage all

**Invoices & Invoice Items:**

- Only authenticated users can access

**Clients:**

- Only authenticated users can access

### Data Validation

- All form inputs have required validation
- Price fields validated as numbers
- Email fields validated as email format
- Phone fields use tel input type
- Unique constraints on bouquet names
- Unique constraints on invoice numbers

### Authentication

- Supabase email/password auth
- Configurable allowed email domains
- Session persistence
- Auto-refresh tokens
- Sign-out functionality

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexes on Foreign Keys**

   - Faster joins on client_id, invoice_id, order_id

2. **Service Worker Caching**

   - Instant load times for repeat visits
   - Reduced API calls

3. **Event Debouncing**

   - Search input uses input event (not keyup)
   - Efficient re-rendering

4. **Selective Rendering**

   - Only render active tab content
   - Lazy-load invoice items on dialog open

5. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Single query with joins for orders + clients
   - Ordering in database rather than JavaScript

## 💡 Tips for Customization

### Change Invoice Number Format

Edit function in `supabase-migration.sql`:

invoice_num := 'INV-' || to_char(current_date, 'YYYYMM') || '-' || lpad(next_number::text, 4, '0');
```

### Add New Bouquet Fields

1. Add column to `bouquet_types` table
2. Add input field to `settings.html`
3. Update `js/settings.js` save/load functions

### Customize Brand Colors

Edit in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
  --accent: #e0724c; /* Change this to your brand color */
  --accent-dark: #b05b3c;
}
```

### Add Invoice Status

1. Add option to invoice status select in `index.html`
2. Add CSS for status pill in `styles.css`
